Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton Exercises - Chapter 8

Note that you will experience problems running the code in this chapter as is.  Details of why relate to Monads which 
I have not studied yet.  Download file Parsing.lhs from http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html.

Then you can copy the functions in parser.lhs into your programming file and you can then run eg: eval "2+3*4" in WinGHCi.


1. The library file also defines a parser:
int :: Parser Int

for an integer.  

Without looking at this definition, define int. Hint: an integer is either a minus symbol followed by a natural number, 
or a natural number.


int :: Parser Int
int = do 

...

In view of complications of Monads I have decided to postpone completion of this chapter.  moving to chapter 9 and 
will return to this chapter at some later stage.
