Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton Exercises - Chapter 7

1. Show how the list comprehension [f x | x <- xs, p x] can be re-expressed using the higher-order functions map 
and filter.

Well given a list comprehension like:

[(+7) x | x <- [1..10], odd x]

you can do this using map and filter like this:

map (+7) (filter odd [1..10])

so given a function f, a predicate p and a list lst, it can be expressed as:

map f (filter p lst)
